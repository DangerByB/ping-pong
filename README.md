The "Ping-Pong" game is a multiplayer game.

Player 1 controls the left racket using the keyboard keys. Player 2 controls the right racket using the keyboard keys.

The task is to hit the ball until one of you misses it.

The game was made in "Algoritmika" lessons by a second-year Python student. I hope you really enjoy the game!
